_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The function performs to provide the infromation surface at given
     information direction.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     inf.2D(alpha, a1, a2, d, correlation = 0, azimuthal_angle = 0, colatitude_angle = 15, filename = "NA", type = "jpeg")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   alpha: The direction of information (the angle between the theta 1
          and the information direction) 

      a1: The item discrimination parameters for theta 1 

      a2: The item discrimination parameters for theta 2

       d: The item difficulty parameters

correlation: The correlation between theta 1 and theta 2. If the
          correlation does not equal to zero, the a1 and a2 will be
          transformed to maintain the orthogonal assumption of the two
          dimensions of thetas 

azimuthal_angle: The azimuthal angle to view the plot  

colatitude_angle: The colatitude angle to view the plot 

filename: The filename in which the user saves the plot; if the
          filename is provided, the function will automatically save
          the plot for the users by the provided filename. 

    type: The format of files in which the user saves the plot 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The information is calculated based on the formula:
     inf=P*(1-P)*(a1*cos(alpha1)+a2*cos(alpha2))^2, where P is the
     positive response probability, 1-P is the negative response
     probability, a1 and a2 is the item discrimination  parameters and
     alpha1+ alpha2=90.
