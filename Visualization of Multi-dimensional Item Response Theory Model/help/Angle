_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The function is provided to calculate the average of angles
     (information direction) where the test has maximum information for
     each examine with certain total score.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     Angle(a1, a2, d, correlation = 0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      a1: The item discrimation parameters for theta 1 

      a2: The item discrimation parameters for theta 2

       d: The item diffiulcty parameters 

correlation: The correlation between theta 1 and theta 2. If the
          correlation does not equal to zero, the a1 and a2 will be
          transformed to maintain the orthogonal assumption of the two
          dimensions of thetas 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The function automatically simulates the two dimensions of thetas
     based on multivate normal distribution with mean zero and the
     provided correlation.
